## 1) Problem

This app aims to help people plan out non-driving trips with multiple stops. It will estimate the prices of tickets for transportation between multiple locations (ie. Los Angeles -> London -> Rome -> Los Angeles) with given days of travel.

## 2) Audience

The application is for people who plan long trips or trips that involve a lot of travelling, like visiting many countries in Europe.

## 3) Requirements

* Each user account will be able to make multiple trips
* Each trip will have multiple locations with travel dates and cost estimates
* Each city will also have a basic information page
* Form control: The user adding locations to their trip
* AJAX request: Querying an API that returns flight travel estimates between 2 cities
* Reusable component: Graphic that make the cities in a trip look connected in a timeline

## 4) Libraries

I may use the Styled Components library to create the different components that make up each trip
